# üõãÔ∏è Room Redesign Assistant  
**An AI-powered tool to visualize and shop your dream room.**

## üöÄ Overview  
Room Redesign Assistant is a full-stack AI application that simplifies interior design by helping users **visualize a redesigned version of their room** and directly **purchase suggested items from Amazon**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  
1. **Upload Your Room Image**  
   Users begin by uploading a photo of their existing room.

2. **Choose a Design Theme**  
   Options include styles like *modern*, *vintage*, *relaxed*, and more.

3. **AI-Powered Redesign**  
   Using Google Gemini's image generation model, the app:
   - Identifies the existing layout.
   - Suggests decor and furniture tailored to the chosen theme.
   - Generates a new image showing the transformed room.

4. **View Final Product in Your Room**  
   Users can see what the suggested redesign would look like in their actual room environment ‚Äî creating a realistic visual before making any changes.

5. **Shop the Look**  
   The app fetches real product listings from Amazon, allowing users to:
   - View item details and pricing.
   - Click through and purchase directly from Amazon.
